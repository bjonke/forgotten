Morlochs are huge masses of walking fur and muscle. Possessing a great deal of natural magic, they make excellent magic-users. However, because they are so ugly, they cannot easily charm some monsters, and their life span is almost as short as a humans. They also have a pretty good resistance to certain forms of monster attacks (Poison and Disease amongst others).
