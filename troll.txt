A cross between an Ogre and an Elf, Trolls are strong and swift creatures that possess a few natural resistances. Making excellent Ninjas and Scavengers, they are quick to take up sides (either Good or Evil), but can sometimes be found as Neutral. Due to the aggressiveness in relation to their alignment, many guilds will not allow them.
