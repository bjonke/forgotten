Giants live for one thing - slicing a monster in two with one blow. Known for their brutal ways and having the advantage of being over eight feet tall, they make the best Warriors one can find. The only guilds to accept them are the Nomad, Seeker and Warrior guilds. Because of their size and bulk, Giants are resistant to most forms of attack, including Fire, Cold and Electrical. Poison and Disease don’t seriously affect them either.
