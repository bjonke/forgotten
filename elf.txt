Elves are the magic users of the game. Tall and slender, most Elves become either Mages, Sorcerers, Healers or Wizards. They are excellent spell casters and can live longer than any other race. They are not, however, very good at fighting with weapons and have a low constitution. Elves also have a natural resistance to Magical and Mind attacks. Because of their lack of physical strength, there are some items (which require great strength) that Elves can never use.
